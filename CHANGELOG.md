# MIRAGE·XR Changelog

# Change Log

# v2.2 (2023-05-04)

## Featured:
- **Grid**. We created a new visual grid system and a snap-to-grid feature which significantly improves the usability of augmentation placement. The drop position is indicated with a 'ghost preview' of the currently selected augmentation. Grid spacing, default rotation angles, and default resizing steps can now be configured.
- **Better editors**. We redesigned the model editors of the image, video, audio, label, and model augmentations.
- **HoloLens is back**. We updated the world space implementation to bring the HoloLens 2 application back in line with current developments.
## Added:
- We rewrote the calibration routines for both edit mode and view mode, adding a floor manager to allow setting the floor plane.
- We added gallery upload functionality on mobiles for the step marker feature of task stations and for the image/video augmentations.
- We added a player tutorial for mobiles and smart glasses which uses a tutorial activity that is written out internally every time the tutorial is started to ensure the viewer tutorial is not modified by the user.
- The marker feature of task stations now shows up with a preview thumbnail button in view mode.
- We added auto-saving of the activity title.
## Changed:
- We simplified the functionality of the pick and place augmentation, added a trigger for incorrect placement, and improved its manipulation when using a 3D model instead of the default arrow.
- We added auto-detection of orientation for images.
- We removed the 'Search' button from the bottom panel on all screens except the 'Home' screen.
- The ARETE learning record store has now been taken offline, so we removed this LRS option. Please switch to WEKIT learning record store.
## Fixed:

# v2.0 (2023-02-08)

## Featured
- New and improved mobile user interface. We completely redesigned the concept of user interaction and dialogues on the mobile platforms. The app now has a significantly improved usability and user experience, and many new features.
- Context help. We introduced a new dynamic context help system, with a comprehensive set of help dialogues for anything we could think of.

- Collapsable main panel: Users can now minimize the main menu, providing ‘prev’/’next’ quick navigation buttons in the collapsed view for moving forwards and backwards between action steps. Especially on smaller screen phones, this frees valuable screen real estate up for a less cluttered view of the activity.

- Character models: We added trigger functionality to character models, moving on to the next action step, when audio or animation are finished playing (whichever takes longer).
- Character models: The AI mode of character models now supports the use of “%%trigger%%” control commands in the text string of their dialogue responses, triggering to move on to the next action step.
- Audio augmentation: We added a 'jump to' option for audio triggers (not just 'next step').
- Action augmentation: We added gaze trigger functionality for action augmentations.
- Preview: We added a preview button from the publish settings to remind content authors to test their activities before uploading to the cloud.
- Marker augmentation: We improved the marker augmentation to display the target image with a 'find this’ instruction and we worked on the anchor stability of the task station during tracking.
- Locate: We reintroduced the locate functionality to activate a red arrow viewfinder pointing to the augmentation it is activated for.
- Acknowledgements: We added logos of new collaborators to the acknowledgements.

## Changed
- Login at the start: The app starts now with the login, also adding buttons for registering (opens browser for web registration) and anonymous guest login.
- Activity stream: We upgraded the activity list to a swipeable activity stream on mobiles and improved the sorting and search functionality.
- Publish dialogue: We created a new ‘Publish...' dialogue to simplify data handling for content authors, with quick access for saving locally and saving to the cloud in public (or private).

- Calibration dialogue: We created a new calibration guide and dialogue, which now starts automatically when a user opens an activity to view.
- Highlight current step: We are now visually highlighting the current step in the step list also on mobiles.
- Keep alive: We created a new dialogue with from/to dials on mobiles for the ‘keep alive’ functionality of augmentations, simplifying setting from which action step to which action step an augmentation shall remain visible.
- Updated views: We implemented new views for activity settings, steps,  list of step contents, content selection, step settings, and profile.
- Activity: We improved the process of deleting activities.

# v1.9 (2022-06-08)

## Featured
- We refactored the core, breaking up ActivityManager and WorkplaceManager into more modular classes, rebuilding a better logic and flow with higher performance. This affects in particular: resuming activities, timing, event handling, bootstrapping, more clean separation of model-view-controller, persistence, addressables, with improved information hiding.
- We added an in-app tutorial for the mobile user interface.
- We migrated the project from GitLab provided by XR4ALL to a new code hosting platform on GitHub, set up new Github runners for Windows and Linux, and refactored our CI pipelines.

## Added

- We improved the built-in tutorial for the world space smart glasses user interface, changing wording, adding steps, and fixing a bug.
- Several improvements to the character augmentation ensure that: the position marker does not slip so easily underneath the spatial map; handling of triggers; and a bug causing the edit panel to stay visible in the viewer.
- The app version is now passed through via the IEEE P1589-2020 activity model to the repository. 

## Fixed
